The Monty language is a programming/scripting language that aims to close the gap between scripting and programming languages. It has a flexible type system, a single-inheritance class hierarchy, and supports both nonvariant and covariant generic classes. It was designed by David A. Watt and specified within a student project at the University of Bremen in 2013 and 2014. The name Monty is derived from Monty Python, a British comedy group that also inspired the name of Python, another scripting language.üêç
